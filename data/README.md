## How to import the database
The first part to getting the database is simple. Run the first half of the tableCreation.sql file. Don't run any of the copy statements locally as they won't work. After you've created the tables right click on the tables and select import. Then use the files in the ThirdNormalFormTables folder to import the respective table. I've altered the .csv files from the originals since there's some issues with missing data when you try and import them. It may take several tries to import them correctly. You may get various error messages due to key configurations. It's important to try and import the tables without dependencies first. That means you should try and import users, milestones, and event_templates first. Then the others should import relatively simply. Just make sure to read the error messages as they come up (hopefully they don't but... coding laws probably don't allow for that).
